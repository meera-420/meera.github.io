<h3>ABOUT</h3>

<p class="test2" >REVIVE Candles was co-founded in 2022 by four undergraduate students. The concept was inspired in hopes of creating the best aromatic product that can be used by essentially Everyone.
These four students had watched as their friends, peers, family, and even themselves struggle to maintain a sense of self after long days and weeks of work. That is why they came together to create this soul healing and REVIVING product.</p>
